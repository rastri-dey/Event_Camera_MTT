# Event_Camera_MTT
This is a research project for ROB 590 Independent Study for Winter 2022 at the University of Michigan. The goal of this project is to perform Multiple Target Tracking for Event Camera Data. The work has been evaluated on 3 indoor datasets collected by the research group at the University of Zurich, for target tracking using event streams. 
## Installations
Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:
mkdir Data
```
Download the dataset from https://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/davis_data.html
The dataset are available in zip format of text files. Convert the .txt files in MATLAB table format and save as .mat files indicated below:

Save "shapes_rotation.txt" as "events_shapes_rotation.mat"
Save "shapes_translation.txt" as "events_shapes_translation.mat"
Save "shapes_6dof.txt" as "events_shapes_6dof.mat"

## Result
